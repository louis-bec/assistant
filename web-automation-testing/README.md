# Web Automation Testing

This project is designed for automated testing of web applications using Node.js and the Jest framework. It provides a structured approach to writing and executing tests, ensuring the functionality of the web application is verified.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd web-automation-testing
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:
```
npm test
```

This will execute all test cases defined in the `src/tests` directory using Jest.

### Writing Tests

Tests are located in the `src/tests` directory. You can create new test files following the naming convention `*.test.js`. Each test file should export a test suite that includes one or more test cases.

### Utility Functions

Utility functions can be defined in the `src/utils/helper.js` file. These functions can be imported and used across different test cases to avoid code duplication and improve maintainability.
